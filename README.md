## Cucumber
Cucumber is a tool that supports Behaviour-Driven Development(BDD), If you’re new to Behaviour-Driven Development read BDD introduction first.

Cucumberjs
is an open-source software testing tool written in Javascript, while the tests are written in Gherkin, a non-technical and human-readable language.
Gherkin Syntax
Gherkin uses a set of special keywords to give structure and meaning to executable specifications. Each keyword is translated to many spoken languages; in this reference we’ll use English.

Each line that isn’t a blank line has to start with a Gherkin keyword, followed by any text you like. The only exceptions are the feature and scenario descriptions.

The primary keywords are:

 * Feature
 * Rule (as of Gherkin 6)
 * Example (or Scenario)
 * Given, When, Then, And, But for steps (or *)
 * Background
 * Scenario Outline (or Scenario Template)
 * Examples (or Scenarios)
